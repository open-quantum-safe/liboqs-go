# Version 0.12.0 - January 15, 2025

- Fixes https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/issues/44. The API that
  NIST has introduced in [FIPS 204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final)
  for ML-DSA includes a context string of length >= 0. Added new API for
  signing with a context string
  - `func (sig *Signature)
SignWithCtxStr(message []byte, context []byte) ([]byte, error)`
  - `func (sig *Signature)
VerifyWithCtxStr(message []byte, signature []byte, context []byte,
publicKey []byte) (bool, error)`
- Updated examples to use `ML-KEM` and `ML-DSA` as the defaults
- Removed the `oqs.rand` package and moved the `RandomBytes` functions from
`oqs.rand` to the main `oqs` package to avoid warnings about linking liboqs
twice

# Version 0.10.0 - March 27, 2024

- Bumped Go version to 1.21
- Replaced CHANGES by
  [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/blob/main/CHANGES.md),
  as we now use Markdown format to keep track of changes in new releases
- Removed the NIST PRNG as the latter is no longer exposed by liboqs' public
  API
- Added the
  [.config-static](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/tree/main/.config-static)
  pkg-config configuration directory for linking statically against liboqs, see
  [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/blob/main/README.md)
  for more details
