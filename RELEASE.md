## About

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography. More
information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github
at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. See more about liboqs
at [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/), including a list of
supported algorithms.

**liboqs-go** is an open source Go wrapper for the liboqs C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.
Details about liboqs-go can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/blob/main/README.md).
