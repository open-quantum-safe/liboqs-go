liboqs-go version 0.7.2
=======================

About
-----

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography. More
information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github
at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. See more about liboqs
at [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/), including a list of
supported algorithms.

**liboqs-go** is an open source Go wrapper for the liboqs C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.
Details about liboqs-go can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/blob/main/README.md).
See in particular limitations on intended use.

# `Dockerfile for liboqs-go`

This is a multistage Dockerfile for building liboqs and setting up liboqs-go.

You can pull the container from Dockerhub with:

```bash
docker pull openquantumsafe/go
```

You can build the container with:

```bash
docker build -t openquantumsafe/go .
```

You can start the container and run the tests with:

```bash
docker run openquantumsafe/go
```

If you want to mount your current directory into the container and use it as an development environment:

```bash
 docker run --rm -it --workdir=/app -v ${PWD}:/app openquantumsafe/go /bin/bash 
```

# `Contribution`

If you want to contribute, please make sure that the dockerfile passes all hadolint tests.
After intalling hadolint, you can check it with:

```
docker run --rm -i hadolint/hadolint < Dockerfile
```
