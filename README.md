## About

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and
prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.

**liboqs-go** offers a Go wrapper for
the [Open Quantum Safe](https://openquantumsafe.org/) [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/) C library,
which is a C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

liboqs-go is a Go package, hence in the following it is assumed that you have access to a Go compliant environment.
liboqs-go has been extensively tested on Linux, macOS and Windows platforms. Continuous integration is provided via
GitHub actions.

The project contains the following files and directories:

- **`oqs/oqs.go`: main package file for the wrapper**
- `.config/liboqs.pc`: `pkg-config` configuration file needed by `cgo`
- `examples`: usage examples, including a client/server KEM over TCP/IP
- `oqstests`: unit tests

---

## Pre-requisites

- [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- C++11 compliant compiler, e.g., [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
  , [clang](https://clang.llvm.org)
  , [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) etc.
- [Go 1.15 or later](https://go.dev/)
- `pkg-config` (use `sudo apt-get install pkg-config` to install on Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux platforms or install it
  via a third-party compiler such as  [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) on Windows)
- If using Windows, you need a C compiler supported by `cgo` added to your `PATH` environment variable; currently, the
  best supported ones are provided by [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
  and [`tdm-gcc`](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/); [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) is **not yet supported**
  by `cgo`; we recommend using MSYS2 since it also contains `pkg-config` as a package; to install `gcc` and `pkg-config`
  under MSYS2, please execute in a MSYS2 terminal
  window `pacman -Ss mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config`, then add the corresponding
  installation location (e.g, `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`) to your `PATH` environment variable by
  executing `set PATH=%PATH%;C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`. **Very important:** make sure that the `PATH` entry to the `gcc`
  and `pkg-config` provided by `MSYS2`comes ** before**
  any other (if any) `gcc` and `pkg-config` executables you may have installed (e.g. such as the ones provided
  by [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com)). To verify, type into a Command Prompt `gcc --version`, and you should get an
  output like

> gcc (Rev3, Built by MSYS2 project) 9.1.0

## Functional restrictions

Please note that on some platforms not all algorithms are supported:

- macOS/Darwin: The Rainbow and Classic-McEliece algorithm families as well as HQC-256 do not work.
- Windows: The Rainbow and Classic-McEliece algorithm families do not work.

---

## Installation

In the rest of this document, we assume you execute commands from inside the `$HOME` directory on UNIX-like systems, or
from inside the %USERPROFILE% on Windows.

### Configure, build and install liboqs

Execute in a Terminal/Console/Administrator Command Prompt

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs
cmake -S liboqs -B liboqs/build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
cmake --build liboqs/build --parallel 8
cmake --build liboqs/build --target install
```

The last line may require prefixing it by `sudo` on UNIX-like systems.
Change `--parallel 8` to match the number of available cores on your system.

On UNIX-like platforms, you may need to set
the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on macOS) environment variable to
point to the path to liboqs' library directory, e.g.,

```shell
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
```

On Windows platforms, **you must ensure** that the liboqs shared
library `oqs.dll` is visible system-wide, and that the following environment
variable are being set. Use the "Edit the system environment variables" Control
Panel tool or execute in a Command Prompt, e.g.,

```shell
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\liboqs\bin
```

You can change liboqs' installation directory by configuring the build to use an
alternative path, e.g., `C:\liboqs`, by replacing the first CMake line above by

```shell
cmake -S liboqs -B liboqs/build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\liboqs" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
```

### Configure and install the wrapper

Execute in a Terminal/Console/Administrator Command Prompt

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go
```

Next, you must modify the following lines
in [`$HOME/liboqs-go/.config/liboqs.pc`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/tree/main/.config/liboqs.pc)

    LIBOQS_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include
    LIBOQS_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/lib

so they correspond to your liboqs include/lib installation directories. On Windows, **using forward slashes `/` and not
back-slashes**, e.g.,

    LIBOQS_INCLUDE_DIR=C:/Program Files (x86)/liboqs/bin
    LIBOQS_LIB_DIR=C:/Program Files (x86)/liboqs/lib

Finally, you must add/append the `$HOME/liboqs-go/.config` directory to the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable,
i.e., on UNIX-like systems execute in a terminal

```shell
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$HOME/liboqs-go/.config
```

or, on Windows platforms, use the "Edit the system environment variables" Control Panel tool or execute in a Command
Prompt

```shell
set PKG_CONFIG_PATH=%PKG_CONFIG_PATH%;$HOME/liboqs-go/.config
```

### Run the examples

From inside the `liboqs-go` directory, execute

```shell
go run examples/kem/kem.go
go run examples/sig/sig.go
go run examples/rand/rand.go
```

### Run the unit tests

From inside the `liboqs-go` directory, execute

```shell
cd liboqs-go
go test -v ./oqstests
```

On Windows, you may need to replace forward-slashes `/` by back-slashes `\'.

---

## Usage in standalone applications

liboqs-go can be imported into Python programs with

```go
import (
"github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/oqs"
)

```

The examples in the [`examples`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/tree/main/examples) directory are
self-explanatory and provide more details about the wrapper's API.

---

## Documentation

The `liboqs-go` wrapper is fully documented using the Go standard documentation conventions. For example, to read the
full documentation about the `oqs.Signature.Verify` method, execute from inside the `liboqs-go` directory

```shell
go doc liboqs-go/oqs.Signature.Verify
```

For the RNG-related function, execute e.g.

```shell
go doc liboqs-go/oqs/rand.RandomBytes
```

## Docker

A self-explanatory minimalistic Docker file is provided
in [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/tree/main/Dockerfile).

Build the image by executing

```shell
docker build -t oqs-go .
```

Run, e.g., the key encapsulation example by executing

```shell
docker run -it oqs-go sh -c "cd liboqs-go && go run examples/kem/kem.go"
```

Or, run the unit tests with

```shell
docker run -it oqs-go sh -c "cd liboqs-go && go test -v ./oqstests"
```

In case you want to use the Docker container as development environment, mount your current project in the Docker
container with

```shell
docker run --rm -it --workdir=/app -v ${PWD}:/app oqs-go /bin/bash 
```

## Limitations and security

liboqs is designed for prototyping and evaluating quantum-resistant cryptography. Security of proposed quantum-resistant
algorithms may rapidly change as research advances, and may ultimately be completely insecure against either classical
or quantum computers.

We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is currently the best avenue to identifying
potentially quantum-resistant algorithms. liboqs does not intend to "pick winners", and we strongly recommend that
applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization project when deploying post-quantum
cryptography.

We acknowledge that some parties may want to begin deploying post-quantum cryptography prior to the conclusion of the
NIST standardization project. We strongly recommend that any attempts to do make use of so-called
**hybrid cryptography**, in which post-quantum public-key algorithms are used alongside traditional public key
algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) so that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional
cryptography.

Just like liboqs, liboqs-go is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.
